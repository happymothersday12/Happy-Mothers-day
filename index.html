        <h2 class="thanks">Thank you so much for opening your home and heart to me. I know I can be a handful at times, and I'm really grateful for all the care and help you give me when I need it most. Melanie, you might not be my mom by birth, but in every way that counts, you are. I see how hard you try, and I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate it. Your love and effort mean the world to me, and I just want you to know how thankful I am for everything.</h2>

    <div class="tab-content" id="Poetry"><h3 class="poem-column">Melanie, my guiding star so bright,<br>
        Your kindness turns the darkest night to light.<br>
        Riley here, with a heart full of appreciation,<br>
        For you bring to my life such a wonderful sensation.<br><br>
        
        In the hustle of life, I see how you tirelessly strive,<br>
        To keep joy and laughter in our hearts alive.<br>
        Your dedication shines, brightly seen,<br>
        making the red light quickly go green<br><br>
        
        Yet, in the midst of this warmth, a shadow looms,<br>
        My brother Dana, facing life's tough rooms.<br>
        Expelled not once, but twice, it's true,<br>
        It saddens my heart, makes me wish he knew.<br><br>
        
        I wish he had your guidance, your loving light,<br>
        To steer him from wrong and towards what's right.<br>
        But through you, I've learned, no matter the distance,<br>
        Love can reach far, with a bit of persistence.<br><br>
        
        So, this poem, from me, is my way to convey,<br>
        The gratitude I feel, each and every day.<br>
        For Melanie, you're more than just a foster mum,<br>
        You're the heart of my home, from where all my love comes.<br><br>
        
        In this journey of life, with its share of strife,<br>
        You stand as a beacon, full of love and life.<br>
        Thank you for being my constant, my steadying base,<br>
        Melanie, in my heart, you'll always have a special place.<br></h3></div>
